# GettingStarted, A Repository of Training Materials in Python for Geoscientists
### Written by Emily Pease, Ameredev II

These notebooks contain training materials for scientific programmers of all levels.  

They require **Python** 3.6, **Anaconda**, and (optional) **git** for use beyond web viewing.


## Fundamentals to help you get started:

To download a Github repository:
- Open terminal
- Navigate to your desired location for download and type

	`git clone https://github.com/ecpease/GettingStarted.git`

	**OR**

- Click the green box on the top right of the home screen of the repository and click Download

To download a Python package:
- Google search for the package you want
- *typically* `conda install package` or `pip install package` (check specific instructions)

To open a new Jupyter Notebook:
- Open terminal
- Navigate to your desired location from which to view/create notebooks (see below if you haven't done this before)
- type `jupyter notebook` and after a few seconds you'll see a notebook open in your web browser

Jupyter notebook shortcuts:
- `SHIFT+ENTER` to run a code block
- Click to the left and `a` to create a code block above the current block
- Click to the left and `b` to create a code block below the current block
- Click to the left and `m` to change the code block to a markdown block


Basic terminal commands to work with files and navigate:
- `ls` - list directory (`dir` for Windows)
- `cd [folder name]` - change directory
- `cd ..` - go back a folder
- `cd` - return to home directory
- `rm [file]` - delete file
- `rm -r [dir]` - delete directory
- `mv file1 file2` - rename a file
- `cp file1 file2` - copy file1 to file2
